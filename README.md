# R-for-basic-linear-Matrix-algebra
This repository contains the material for course titled "Computational Linear Algebra" of my PG curriculum. 
This is a project which I submitted as per course requirement. I used Rsweave to execute the R codes alongwith typestting the theory using latex(that's how knittr works!!).

The language for programming is R as it serves the purpose for linear algebra quite effecinetly and beautifully.
There are two files, one is the final pdf and the other is .Rnw file which is the raw/source code for building the document.
